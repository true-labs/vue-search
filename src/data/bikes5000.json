I am not sure if it was stolen at night or while I walked my dog in the morning. My gut says it was in the morning, around 7:30 when I walked my dog. I feel like someone must have been watching me or they would not have known it was not locked. \r\n\r\nDetails on my bike, it's a Women's bike. White with a rainbow rocket sticker on it. It has thicker tires than normal european bikes. Sit Upright style, 8 or 7 speed (don't remember) and a cute black basket in the front.  I can't seem to find my instructions.  I did register the bike though.",

When I got to work, there was an old black SUV w/bikes strapped to the top in the parking lot.  It was backed into the spot w/no license plate on the front.  There were two more people each on a bike w/a pull behind next to the SUV.  I didn't see them take my bike, but I've been bike to work for 6 yrs w/out issue until today.",

I’m helping him find his bike because he worked super hard to save up the money for it, and was just getting into 100k rides. He wanted to do Seattle to Portland this summer. ",

  "description": "My husband and I live in a single-family home with a detached garage in the West Town/Logan Square area. We rode our bikes to grab food after a concert and returned home a little after midnight on Wednesday night (June 5th) /Thursday morning (June 6th). We parked the bikes in our garage, hit the garage door button, and went inside for the night. Unfortunately, we think something might have been in the way of the garage door, causing it to open back up after we went inside. Our neighbors knocked on our door around 7:00PM on Thursday to inform us that our garage door had been open all day. Since we didn't go into the garage during the day on Thursday, we know it never closed when we got home Wednesday night. The only items missing were our Trek bikes. They were stolen sometime between 12:00AM - 7:00PM on Thursday, June 6th. ",

My roommate had noticed one morning that one of the bikes under the window had been moved across the yard to a corner we never keep our bikes, but thought maybe our other roommate moved it to dry off his seat. \r\n\r\nOn June 11 when cleaning out our patio, we noticed my bike and the cruiser we keep for guests were both gone. Based on where in the yard our other bike was left, our best guest is 1-2 people grabbed the bikes, lifted them over the fence in the lowest spot (that corner) and had to leave before they could take the third bike. My landlord has a camera outside the building, and I still need to get through the footage to see if it caught anything. \r\n\r\nBike one is a bright turquoise specialized brand bike with black fenders and solid tires that don't require air. It has an NOPD License # of 00891\r\n\r\nBike two is a Sun cruiser, light teal with a black seat with white trim.",

  "description": "The last time I rode my bike was Tuesday, June 4 at about 9pm. I didn't notice it was missing until 9am this morning, June 6. I\r\npark right next to the bike rack and didn't see it gone yesterday, June 5th, but I also didn't actively look for it. This morning I\r\nnoticed it was missing and that the lock had been cut.\r\nI talked to the apartment management and they said they would review the security footage.\r\nThe garage is on the ground level, attached to the building. There are three entrances - one near the bike rack (but it has no\r\ndoorknob on the outside and is locked), one from the main apartment lobby, and the main garage entrance. My bike was on\r\nthe rack furthest from the two entrances that could have been used.\r\nNote that the serial number could either be BM37398 or BM3739B; it's hard to read the handwriting on the receipt.",

  "description": "Hey all, just got my $3500 ebike stolen by a guy who said he wanted to buy it. He said he wouldn't buy it unless he tried it. God I hate myself right now. If anyone sees it posted to sell, let me know. Here's some pictures of the bike and his fake ID. \r\n\r\nHe is a late 30's early 40's 6'3-6'5\" caucasian male with light blue/green eyes. His hair is long and slicked back and has facial hair identical to the photo provided. No visible tattoos. He wore a long sleeve green jacket with tan pants.\r\n\r\nPrior to the sheriffs arrival to my location, they were responding to a call to a nearby street for 2 men loading a bike into a u-haul attached to a red Cadillac and the callers said the whole situation seemed very suspicious. Unfortunately they did not make it in time. The sheriffs think that was my bike or the thieves were stealing multiple bikes in the area.\r\n\r\nWe met up at Yes Plaza in Rowland Heights because the plaza is well lit and the majority of the restaurants were still open during that time. The location was also in front of a Los Angeles County Sheriff service station (it turns out its only operated by volunteers and open during specific hours).\r\n\r\nHe approached me from a direction I wasn't looking at and said his girlfriend dropped him off and that she was getting gas for the truck. Initially I refused his request to demo my bike and I went around the parking lot a few times to show him that the bike is functioning. I should've stuck with my gut or at least held all his possessions as a deposit. In hindsight the thief seemed pushy and I believe he was trying to distract me from looking too closely at his ID.\r\n\r\nI should've known better but one thing that really threw me off is when he said \"I can't buy this unless I try it\" I thought it was a fair point as it's a pretty expensive 2nd hand purchase. Theft wasn't on my mind as much as liability. What if he hit someone or a car? Or dropped the bike? Taking off with the bike was on the lower end of the list of my worries at the time.\r\n\r\nThere was no way for me to catch the thief as the bike reaches up to 50 mph on flat ground when the speed limiter is off.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following are defining specs of the electric bike\r\nFox 40 forks\r\nBlack 100amp controller\r\n72v 30ah battery \r\n80/100 - 21 Motorcycle tubes\r\n26\" Schwalbe big apple road tires\r\nEnduro stealth bomber frame /vector frame \r\n6 speed Shimano cassette w/ derailleur \r\nBlue under glow lightning\r\nScratch on right side due to loose BB that follows the curve of the pedal path\r\n\r\nReward for info leading to arrest or return of the bike",

  "description": "On May 22, 2019, I locked my bright blue Giant Escape 2 bike to a street lamp outside the (great) coffee shop Doubting Thomas, on Temple, in Echo Park. There are no bike locking racks outside, so I had no option. Except the lamp is so thick, I couldn't use my U-lock and had to use my bike cable and the U-lock together. At some point while I was INSIDE the coffee shop, barely 50 feet away, someone clipped my bike cable and stole my bike. I bought it in September of last year -- it's 9 months old! (And it has a distinct silver bottle cage on it.) I know this is a long shot but I felt like I had to do something.

  "description": "Bike was in my apartment garage, which should have been closed and locked (But people coming and going forget to close it). Then inside the garage, I had my bike locked within a fenced area for storage with a padlock. However, due to a design flaw with the gate, the latch that was  secured by the padlock (to prevent the latch from lifting up to open the gate), was not wrapped securely around the pole. This meant that the thief was able to forcefully pull on the gate and bend the end of the latch enough to have access to the storage unit.",

Bike has a “Zombie Hunting Permit” sticker on the side of the frame.  When I last had it, one of the brake bars had snapped on the handle (rider’s right side).  It has Rockshox shocks.  I believe it possible that the thief may have gotten smart and repainted it, but some of its features I believe would still stand out.  I am unclear on the exact date it was stolen.",

  "description": "At about 6pm on Monday May 13, 2019 I locked my bike using the bike's built-in wheel lock right outside of Nordstrom Rack at 5th and Pine. This locks the wheel\r\nfrom moving, but it does not prevent someone from li ing the bike and running away with it.\r\n\r\nI came out of Nordstrom Rack about 630pm and the bike was gone. There is an outdoor camera owned by Nordstrom Rack at 5th and Pine and it might have\r\nfilmed the thief. However, the bike has an accelerometer with a the siren if the bike is moved.\r\nThe thief would have had to lift the bike, and the bike would have sounded a loud siren.\r\n\r\nThe bike also has location tracking built-in. You can track the bike's location here: https://my.vanmoof.com/findmybike/show/F71C603B-021F-8476-8886-00AEF22321B6",

I went to an appointment in an adjacent building from 12pm - 1:00pm.  When rounding the corner after my appointment I was unable to see my bike where I had left it.  When I got to the place I had secured it I found the lock had been cut and someone had stolen my bike.  I asked a street sweeper if he had seen anything - he had not.  I asked a youth standing near by if he had - he had not.  I asked in Ace hardware and the Escala across the street if anyone had seen anything or if there were cameras pointed in that general location - I was informed there were not.  \r\n\r\nI was able to report to 2 officers (on bikes) from the sheriff's office what had happened.  They gave me contact details to email  and text them my bike index info (serial number, photo) which I did.  They headed off to Westlake to see if it was anywhere in the vicinity.  They advised my to call 911 to report it, which I did.  The police system was down on 5/6 so submitted today. ",

  "description": "Stolen Bike - 5:20PM May 4th From Safeway @69th \u0026 Sandy\r\nMy boyfriend and I were shopping in Safeway, couldn't have been in there for more than 15-20 mins, and my Kona mountain bike was clipped and stolen. It was locked to the bike rack outside, next to other bikes. The moment we discovered the clipped lock, someone drove up to us and said they saw the guy walk way with it - white guy with a ball cap and curly brown hair coming out from below the cap. He was walking the bike away on Fremont headed west towards (68th/67th). We cruised around for nearly 90 minutes looking for it in the neighborhood. Super bummed, it was a really nice bike and we just had the best day too. If anyone sees it around, please let me know. It is a green Kona mountain bike, full suspension, with a black and orange sticker on the frame that says LOLO RACKS. It does not have a lock hanging off of it. We are about to report to police, and will also submit to bike index. We did a craigslist search alert too. Any other tips, we are all ears. Thank you so much for activating the community eyes!! \r\n\r\nDescription of person involved – Hair: Hat, curly brown hair coming out from under hat, Other details: Walked away with my bike from Safeway",

  "description": "My husband and I went to see a movie at Canal Place Theater on April 30, 2019 and arrived and locked bikes up at the public bike rack on Iberville St. directly in front of the Lululemon storefront window between 7:30 and 7:33 PM. My bike had a Schwinn cable bike lock that is accessed/locked with a key. I ran my lock through the front tire and frame, around the bike rack, and around/through the center frame. After watching the movie, we came outside at approximately 11:10 PM to find that only my husband’s bike was left on the bike rack. My bike and lock were gone.",

The cable was cut, with the front wheel and U-lock left on the bike rack. This method of locking was used as the bike rack was hidden away from the street and because it was difficult to lock the frame to the rack due to the U-lock being too small for this. This incident likely happened at night. All that was left was front tire and U-lock, so the bike may have mismatched tires/brake discs.",

Sadly, someone thought they needed to steal Mitchell’s bike right from underneath his nose around 7:15pm this evening. He rode from our house, down Valley View Drive, to the bridge (near the Green Valley Market). While he was down by the Santa Clara river, a black sedan pulled up and stopped. The passenger, a guy with black hair, 5’ 10”ish, medium build (aged 18-21) jumped out, onto his bike, and quickly rode away up Valley View Drive. Mitch is inconsolable and we’re boiling mad. Please keep an eye out for his Specialized Hot Rocks 24” mountain bike. It’s red with neon yellow highlights. ",

  "description": "I arrived at Dalston Square around 17:30h with my bicycle. I looked for a free rack to lock my bicycle to and I did it. I locked it with to locks, one for the front wheel, the front mudguard and the frame and another lock for the rear wheel, the rear rack and the frame. I left the bicycle there to take the Overground from Dalston Junction to New Cross. I returned to Dalston Junction at 23:00h approximately on the Overground too. I went out of the station to collect my bicycle to head home but the bicycle wasn't there anymore. The only thing that was left was my two cut locks on the floor. I took the locks and I asked the person in charge of the entrance of the Ocean House \u0026 Dekker House as this entrance is just in front of where my bicycle was locked. This person told me that he didn't notice or see anything because he is away from the main door inside the corridor. However, he told me that there are plenty of CCTV cameras in the buildings around. I had a look at the area and I saw at least five other cut locks in the bicycle racks of the square. That is a clear indicator that the bicycle thieves are frequently operating in Dalston Square. On top of that, there is not a lot of light at the square when is dark so this makes the things easier for the thieves. Also, there are a lot of missing parts in the bicycles locked in the street racks. From saddles to wheels, to even the whole front fork which indicates that the thieves had to take a long time to take apart all the nuts and cables. This is again a clear indicator that the thieves operate there very comfortably and very frequently. My two locks must have been cut with a powerful shear. One of them is a solid metal U lock and the other one is a Kryptonite Kryptoflex Coiled Key Cable with Frame Bracket Black lock that was cut too.",

  "description": "I rode my bike home from work on 04/24/2019 at approx 5pm. Put the bike along side 2 other bikes on the covered back porch/deck bike rack. The bikes do not get locked to anything immovable. Stayed home the rest of the night. Throughout this day and night my housemates and I did not hear or see anything unusual. The bike was not checked by me to see if it was still there at any point in the morning or evening pre/post work on 4/25/2019 which is when I am assuming the theft took place. When I went onto the back porch/deck the morning of 04/26/2019 at approx 7am I noticed the bike was stolen and still has not been located. I have yet to check Craigslist or Offerup to see if it has been posted for sale from the burglar. \r\n\r\n(Had) a maroon Kryptonite U-lock locked to the rear fender. Had 3 wraps of coband (two tan and one blue) around the middle frame holding the brake lines to the frame. Handlebars are scuffed up. Back fender is very dented. Gatorskin brand rear tire. Bike gallery logo located on the vertical bar near the crankcase. Middle frame has an area to connect a battery for the internal built in lights in which there is no battery or cover and the 3 prong connection are all broken off. Bike has internal front and rear lights. ",

My gate was closed when i left, when i returned home about an hour later the gate was open.

Brian took it for a \"test ride\" then about 5 minutes later Donna told me Brian intended to steal it to begin with and she was not going to help him pay for it. Next Donna said she had to run errands and told me I had to leave her property (they both invited me to their home to discuss the sale). When I questioned this Donna told me Brian was the \"bike king\". I told her in person and Brian over the phone they must return the bicycle or I would report it to law enforcement. Donna became combative and argumentative saying it was Brian's fault and she did not know where he was going or when she would see him again (they are married and reside together and remain so after the fact). Over several more phone calls and text messages throughout the day Brian became angry and made death threats towards myself and other witnesses saying they would be shot and he had a gun. The matter was reported to Portland (Oregon) Police Bureau's East Precinct Special Property Crimes and Robbery Detective's Unit.",

  "description": "Monday morning I used a Kryptonite U-lock to lock the front wheel and frame of my bike to a bike rack at the Mountain View Caltrain station (wave-style rack on the southbound side, the one closer to the transit center). I also used a cable to connect the back wheel to the U-lock. I took the 7:25am northbound Caltrain, and when I returned at 6:03pm, my bike was gone. My helmet was left next to the broken U-lock and cable on the ground.",

The proprietors of the restaurant across the street, didn’t remember seeing the bike get stolen. But, there are cameras at the station, so the thief may be on video.

I went in and came out to find my bike lock cut where I parked it, and a customer saw me and said \"did somebody just steal your bike!?\" I said, \"Yes!\" and she said \"I JUST saw him, he went that way!\" and I saw him ride across the parking lot. I tried to chase after him, and he turned and saw me and sped up. I then yelled \"HE STOLE MY BIKE!\" several times to let other people know. He made it down the block and turned off before I could see where he went. Police were notified. Guy was wearing baggy pants, a hooded sweatshirt and a light white/grey colored backpack.",

  "description": "The bike was outside of Gerken's because it needed work done... before it was stolen, the small silver chain cover was bent inwards and the chain could not move along the gears. This is likely still an issue this stolen bike would have. The back wheel was u-locked to the bike seat, so the back wheel is likely off and the bike seat likely damaged. The tires had been recently upgraded so the front tire would be Kevlar lined. It seems that it was possibly posted on the same date it was stolen on OfferUp and sold in the same neighborhood on Wed 4/10 and was likely altered and the original handlebars and pedals may have been taken off and replaced. The first picture posted here is of the possible altered bike after it was stolen. The second picture of the bike is the bike before it was stolen. ",

  "description": "\tI arrived to the library around 11:40AM on April 10th. I parked the bike on the racks at 5th \u0026 Madison. I tried to lock all parts of the bike frame and wheel; they were too big, so I re-did the lock to only include one part of the bike frame, wheel, and rack. I was moving quickly and may not have locked it properly. I have a heavy-duty multi-hinge ABUS lock that is quite strong. There was a man watching me. He was sitting on the ground, near the library, across from the bike rack. He had a bag and looked like he might be living rough. I went into the library quickly and left again by 11:55AM. When I left, the bike was still there. I walked across the street to the 5th \u0026 Madison building. I returned to where I'd parked my bike around 11:55AM. The bike and the lock were gone. The man who had been watching me was also gone.",

  "description": "I discovered this bike stolen 4/10 at 12:00 pm from within a secured storage room at the apartment complex I live in Claremont Apartments at SE Belmont and 42 Ave. The bike was secured onto the door of our assigned storage area in the basement of building 815. The lock was a flexible Kryptonite lock. The lock was discovered cut and still on the storage area door. Tenants can access the storage room with a key provided by the property management company, Greenbridge Properties. I (and other tenants) routinely access this storage room to do laundry and access their property. I was last in the room on 4/8 and my bike was there. I asked a couple of tenants today (4/10) and they didn't recall seeing anything suspicious. I have a picture of the bike and the lock, if needed. I've also posted on Nextdoor: https://nextdoor.com/news_feed/?post=108020169 Thank you for your help. I really appreciate it. ",

  "description": "On April 2 2019 between 4:30pm-5:30pm I had a bike stolen. I biked to Freshco (Frescho Plaza beside the Dollarama on Bayfield) to get some groceries, when I got to Freshco I parked the bike at the rack located around the corner of the Freshco entrance. I went in for 10 minutes and when I came back out, I noticed the bike was no longer at the bike rack. I took a minute to look a around the parking lot to see if I can see if anyone is riding away with it, but I did not see the bike. I thought to myself and decided to go to the sportchek at the Georgian mall to ask them about the serial number on the bike. I walked to the mall and I decided to go right to the entrance of the sportchek atmosphere doors. When I walked in, I noticed a male and a female standing at the service centre where they service bikes. When I went up to the desk I noticed a red bike that look exactly like mine leaning against the side of the service desk, and also noticed that I ripped off the price tag that was originally located on the top of the frame right by the middle of the handlebars. I looked at the male and I said this “That bike looks familiar, I just had it stolen from freshco.” The male replied, “No man we just got back from Toronto and I’m bringing it in to get the seat changed” In my mind I was thinking that was made up. I replied, “Are you sure cause It look very familiar” The male started getting really agitated and replied, “Man now your starting to piss me off you can f**king leave now before I hurt you.” At that point I turned around and left the store and as I was leaving the store, I can hear him laughing in the background and saying stuff. I took the transit home and when I got home, I thought to myself what to do next. I decided to call sportchek and talk to their service centre. When I got hold of the service centre, I explained the situation to the guy, and he remembered who I was and the bike I bought from them. He stated that the male refused to write any of his personal information on the work order. He also stated that the male was very belligerent, and he left the store with the bike without completing the work order. At that time, I had a feeling it was him and it was. ",

(This is crazy because HE WATCHED THIS HAPPENED and did nothing to stop / challenge it. I called 911 to file a police report. I haven’t received a police report number yet.\r\n\r\nThe color of my bike is  is all black.",

  "description": "The E-bike was stolen at 01h05 in the morning of 19 March 2019 in Vienna, Austria. The E-bike had a tracker fitted, but the thief became suspicious when the police arrived at the towerblock where he lives, and he removed the motor from the E-bike and disconnected the tracker. I haven't received any more GPS updates since the police were there. The thief is living in Klosterneuburgerstrasse 111 - a Turkish Community. I suspect that the E-bike will be taken out of Austria to Eastern Europe.\r\nThe E-bike had its 400Wh Bosch battery in the frame, but the display computer was taken off by me. The bicycle has a red hub in front, an a Basil basket on the  rear carrier. The E-bike has a Bosch performance electric motor.\r\n",

The bike was locked with an Abus lock to bike rack #42 in the PB level of the Encore. This is my official bike storage rack as an owner at the Encore. When we went down to get the bike two days ago, we saw the bike was gone. On the floor below the rack was my helmet, and the lock completely sawed through. (That's a lot of steel!) We reported the theft to the management company, Coast Mngmt, and the Encore's HOA association. They suggested we also register the theft here in case the bike was found by police.",

  "description": "At roughly 0700 on Thursday morning, February 14, 2019 I locked my bicycle to one of the many bike racks on the East plaza of 300 E Randolph (the Blue Cross/Blue Shield building), only about 20 feet from the entrance to the building. I used a cable to secure the front wheel to a Kryptonite U-lock. I secured the U-lock to the bike rack, capturing my bike's frame and rear wheel. My bike had a mount for the U-lock on the top bar, a mount for my head light on the handle bars, and a mount for another bike lock on the seat post. \r\n\r\nAt roughly 1600 on Thursday, February 14, 2019 I left my building and noticed that my bike was missing from where I had locked it. There was no sign of the bike, the U-lock, or the cable. I notified building security immediately. One of the team members, Tim, took my name, phone, and bike make, model, and color. He said they would review the footage and let me know what they find. I asked if bike theft was common and all he said was that it does happen. \r\n\r\nThere are two security cameras over looking the East plaza with all of the bike racks that could not have missed me locking my bike to this rack. And, I expect they captured the theft of my bike.",

  "description": "I lost this Specialized CrossRoads Sports bike in the first week of 2019. I am a Reed College student and I use a U-lock to lock it at the Physics Department. It is gone when I checked it on the 4th of January. It has a $10 small while/silver bell(on the right), and a LED light (Left )on the handle of the bike. There is also a small battery wrapped by a little cloth bag, tied using two hook\u0026loops, using a line connected to the light. The bike's stand, a silver one, on the left , is not working very well, a little bit loose, so cannot stand easily but easy to fix. It has a small red light reflection under the seat, which is a little bit old and mottled, it is a Francesco \"Moser\" seat and wrote \"Fmoster\" on the left side of the saddle. There is no bike rear rack, just a black cover, as well as the front wheel. The bike tires are very narrow, looks like racing bike tires. I reported it to the campus police officers and they suggested me to report this to the Portland Police Bureau. I locked it on a bike rack when I went back to the rack, it is all gone\r\nincluding the U-locker. There is no camera around on campus so the security of campus can't help much. Thank you for your time and help!",

  "description": "I parked the bike on the sidewalk in front of the Wawa store on Walnut St. between 9th and 10th streets in Center City, Philadelphia on the evening of Christmas Eve, Dec. 24th 2018 (sometime between 6:15PM and 6:30PM). I locked it to a sign pole with my steel cable number combination lock. After spending no more than 5-6mins. inside the store to get a sandwich, I came out to finding the bike was missing. There were two homeless men who had been standing outside store by the door for the duration (have good suspicion it was them). One of them disappeared at about the same time as the bike. Everything was taken, nothing left at the scene; sign seemed unharmed, lock was taken as well. Not sure if cut with a tool, otherwise broken or if they had figured the combination out somehow.",

After trying for 20 minutes I was unable to get the key out. Figuring that my bike was safe since it was still locked with a cable lock between the rack, bike frame, and front wheel, and since the garage is locked to nonresidents, I gave up and intended to call a locksmith to come help. I left, went to bed, went to work the next day (12/19), and when I checked on my bike at 10:00 pm it was missing. My best guess is that a resident happened to see me in the garage attempting to unlock the bike and returned for a closer look at the lock afterward.",

He managed to get it over the top, and hold it as he rode his bicycle down Howard Avenue.  Ouch!  It hurt to see my transportation getting transported away by a thief.  He was a tall medium build 20ish 30ish black guy (not dark or light but in between)  No facial hair and not much hair on his head. He wore a thick beige jacket with a hood and black pants.  His bike looked like a Schwinn (but don't know.)  I think he had a black milk crate on the back.  My bike had a rear cargo rack.\r\nOfficer Tyrone F. Parker of Unit 5096 B kindly took my report   L-18556-18\r\nThe bike is registered in my name, but I'm still looking for the license # they issued me.\r\nI'm pretty sure my bike's model is an Expedition, but I'm not sure exactly what kind of Expedition.",

The bike storage room in this apartment building has two doors, each requiring a key fob to enter. Before getting into the bike room, the thief also would have had to get through the locked outside door and then the elevator (each requiring the same key fob) or through the outside garage door (requiring the garage door opener).\r\n\r\nI had a total of four bikes. Three of the bikes were locked adjacent to each other, each with its own U-lock connected to a metal bike rack, and with multiple cables locking the bikes to each other and to the metal rack. Two of those three bikes were taken (the two road/racing bikes) and the third was left there.  The fourth bike - also a hybrid bike - was also stolen, which was locked with a u-lock in another location in the bike storage room.\r\n\r\nIt appears other bikes have been stolen from that bike room as there are multiple other locations where locking cables were cut.",

The chain securing the front wheel and the frame of the bike was a Kryptonite  bicycle / New York Fahgettaboudit Chain 1410.

I've done this regularly for the last 2.5 years w/o issue.\r\n\r\nThe theft was called in to the police by a neighbor at 10:05pm, I was on my way out at 10:20pm when I saw police trying to get into the building. The neighbor described the man to the police as heading S on Front Street and then WB on Market Street. \r\n\r\nWith no video evidence, the assumption is he tailgated a resident into the building to steal a package, there was a large pile of Amazon boxes by the door, but once inside he saw the bike and took it. He left an Indego bike share bike outside the front door.\r\n\r\nNote: Surly fork \u0026 rack and Salsa Cowchipper bars are not shown in the pics. They were installed just days before this incident so I don't have updated pictures!",
